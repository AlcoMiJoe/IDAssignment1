ID Assignment 1 - Spice Girls Website (Alecxander Dela Paz)

Design Process

    For my website, I decided to create a website centering around the Spice Girls. For users who are interested in the Spice Girls, the globally famous 90s girl-group, I have made 3 pages about them, their music, and the members, with their different personas being the most unique part that differentiates them from other girl groups. 

    There are 3 Main Pages, the Home page, About page and Merchandise Page. There is no listings for show times as this page is more meant to cater to their fanbase who are nostalgic about one of their favourite girgl groups of all time. As such, there is a Merchandise page in place of a Event Timings page (or whatever you'd like to call it) showcasing different Spice-themed apparel.

    Within the about page is sections dedicated to each Spice Girl, as the main appeal of the band is that anyone could see themselves in one or more of the members. Along with a general synopsis of the group, there are individual paragraph describing the character of each Spice Girl.
